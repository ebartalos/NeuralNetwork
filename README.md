Simple head-only no-growing snake game to showcase neural network and genetic algorithms.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Java 17+ with Kotlin installed.

## Features

### Branch `master`

- Neural network implementation from scratch that adheres to the OOP principles
- Several neuron types - Rectified Linear, Sigmoid and Hyperbolic tangent
- Genetic algorithms - breeding and mutation
- Training function automatically saves best network to the file and will resume back when program is run again
- Simple GUI eater game with already trained neural network
- Backpropagation demonstrated in XOR

### How to run eater

Run main in MainEater. You can select activity in MainEater -
Test (showcases already trained network solving eater game) or Train (training network).

### How to run xor

- Run main in MainXor.
